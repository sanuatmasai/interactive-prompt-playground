Push your code to a public GitHub repository (suggested name: interactive-prompt-playground).

Your repo must include:

The playground code (script or web UI).

A README.md with:

How to run the playground
Description of features (parameter control, model selection, etc.)
A grid/table showing outputs across different settings.

A 2-paragraph reflection explaining how and why the responses changed with different parameters.

Ensure the app/script runs without errors and avoids exposing API keys.

Submit your GitHub repo link (e.g. https://github.com/your-username/interactive-prompt-playground).
